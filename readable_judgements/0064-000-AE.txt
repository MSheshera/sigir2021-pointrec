Description: I'm planning a trip to London in March, and I'm trying to search what art museums there are- I like basically everything except for the lazy stuff people call "modern art". Basically, if it's not a soup can or a line on a piece of paper I like it. So, any recommendations for good museums? And my opinion on modern art is just opinion, so don't give me some bs answer on how I don't get it- I just want a good museum to visit. Thanks!
