Description: I'm planning on taking a girl to a museum on a date but I don't yet know which one. I do want it to be within walking distance of Penn Station though, since I'll be paying for a lot of stuff and would like to at least avoid paying for a cab.  It can be any kind of museum...art, history, whatever...I just need a good recommendation. Thanks!
