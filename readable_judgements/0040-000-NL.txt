Description: I'm from Nashville, TN USA and have a planned trip to London in a couple weeks for work. Will be there over the weekend and would really like to hit a couple bars or clubs that are known for their DJs and House style of music. I checked the wiki and didn't really find exactly what I was looking for so hopefully someone can easily throw me a couple recommendations. I'm in my mid 30's but tend to forget that I'm not in my 20's anymore. Nashville doesn't really have any house music venues so I'm excited to see what European clubs are like. I appreciate the help...
