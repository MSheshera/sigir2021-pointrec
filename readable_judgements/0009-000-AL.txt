Description: My boyfriend and I are visiting Seattle for a few days and seeing a concert at the Gorge Amphitheater on a Saturday in August (9-12). We are trying to decide if we should hike closer to the Seattle area (we are staying in West Seattle) or closer to the Gorge on the day of the concert.  We both love hiking but know nothing about Washington & have never hiked or spent much time there. We usually go for "difficult" trail ratings and we like panoramic views/high elevation/good-payoff-at-the-end hikes. We also know it is a very quick trip and don't want to spend too much time getting to our hiking destination. We also don't know much about the summer weather and how important it would be to find shaded trails v. open to the sun. Any advice is welcome!  We are also really love food and would welcome any food-related recommendations in either of those areas.
