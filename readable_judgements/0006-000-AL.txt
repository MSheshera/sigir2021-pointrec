Description: Hello friends, I'm looking for hiking spots that are on the less populated side. My pup likes to bark at people when he's on the leash, so hiking in populated areas like Ijams have been doable, but a slight bit annoying to myself and I'm sure the poor folks trying to have a relaxing walk that he barks at. House mountain has worked out well for us in the past, but I'd appreciate any recommendations to add a lil' variety. Thanks!
