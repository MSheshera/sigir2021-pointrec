Description: My group of friends have grown out of the standard college bar scene and now we don't know where to go to hang out in the evenings around the city anymore. Something cozy, where you can find a seat, and it's not too loud you can actually hear a conversation. Like, we adore Joebar in Hazel Park but it's a bit out of the way for us (We're on the south end). Any suggestions?
