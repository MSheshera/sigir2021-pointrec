Description: Hi there, r/rva! Let’s see what you’ve got. I’m (26F) not an experienced hiker, but I’m looking for recommendations for the best hiking spots near Richmond this time of year (read: cold). I’m willing to drive up to an hour and a half away. It can be a pretty long daytime hike, but I don’t want to camp or climb rocks with my hands or anything. I was going to go to Humpback Rock, but Google maps says the Blue Ridge Parkway is closed. I didn’t even know that was a thing. All that I ask for is a good view that’s away from the city. Alternatively, let me know if you know of any interesting small towns that you like to walk around. Do people still do these things? Is it okay to go alone?
