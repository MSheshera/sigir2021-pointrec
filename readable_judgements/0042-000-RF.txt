Description: I have searched a bit on google, but wanting to treat my sister to a really nice lunch or dinner before she moves interstate. Any recommendations for the Dandenong and surrounding areas? I’m vegetarian, partner is “flexitarian” and sister is generally not fussy and will eat anything, so long as the place is clean. The price doesn’t bother us much, so long as the venue is worth it - stuffy, uptight, fine dining is generally a pass from us. Thanks in advance for any and all suggestions and have a safe and happy New Year!
