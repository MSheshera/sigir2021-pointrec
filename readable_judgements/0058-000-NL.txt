Description: Hi r/texas! I'm a guy in my late 20's travelling from Sweden to the US for a series of meetings, and the first one will be in Dallas, TX this evening. I'll arrive around 8PM and looking to read a book and catch up on some work at a nice bar in Downtown Dallas. Anyone got any good recommendations? It would be ideal if it would be a semi-calm, yet somehow populated, rock bar or similar where you can simply take a table and enjoy yourself and do some reading or working. Thanks in advance!
