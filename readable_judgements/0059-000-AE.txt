Description: Yo. I'm new to Raleigh, looking to meet new people and have a good time, and I am wondering if anyone might recommend any "nerdy" hangouts? Comic book shops with open DnD or tabletop nights, Friday Night MTG, Smash Bros or Mario Kart tournaments, arcades, VR rooms, LARPing societies, that sort of thing?
