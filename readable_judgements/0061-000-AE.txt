Description: Heya r/Madisonwi ! You guys were super nice and helpful last time I hit y'all up for some help with my gf earlier this year. Well I'm finally getting to meet her for a week! I know about uh, Geeks Mania and we definitely plan to go there. And I just found the cities events page, but anything y'all might recommend personally to do? We're pretty nerdy/gamery types so anything like a science museum that's great would be amazing. Also if there's any ahem kink/BDSM clubs or something that's okay fielding visitors. (Of course, I'ma hit up Google too, but I thought I'd ask y'all too <3) Edit: Also, she's not really explored different different food cultures, so if you guys know of a good Indian, Sushi, Italian, Mexican; places to visit that would make my heart sing <3 <3 <3
