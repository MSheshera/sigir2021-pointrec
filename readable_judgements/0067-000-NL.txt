Description: Some friends and I will be visiting Chicago in a week. A couple have been there, some of us haven't. We're looking for some good nightlife spots, in addition to any offbeat, non-touristy sites that might be worth visiting. Can anyone recommend some good dive bars to check out? Something not douchey and not too hipsterish and definitely not expensive? I'm in my 30s and appreciate places with color and character more than crowds, but crowds are fine too. Thanks in advance for any advice.
