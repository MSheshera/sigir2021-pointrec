Description: Hey guys, I'm heading into the city tonight with about 20 people in our lower to mid 20s. Looking for a place downtown with a good beer selection, not overly pricey, not mega crowded and possibly a dancing area for a bonus. Any bars that jump to mind? I'm always in the city, but its hard picking out a place that can accommodate us. thanks for your expert advice!
