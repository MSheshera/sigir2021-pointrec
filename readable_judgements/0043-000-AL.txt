Description: Hello, I am an exchange student studying at Queen's University in Kingston, ON and I'm going to be in Vancouver from April 29th - May 8th this year. I'm looking to spend a couple of days in Vancouver and spend the remainder of the time doing outdoor activities, mainly hiking trails or climbing mountains, but I'm open to other suggestions too. I like hiking with nice views at the top, and walks that don't require any technical skills to reach the summit etc I am trying to plan my trip and not sure if I should base myself in Vancouver and do day trips or stay in other towns nearer to where the hiking trails are. It's important to note that I won't be able to rent a car since I'm too young, so I either have to use public transport or hitchhike (I know it's illegal in BC but apparently it's pretty common and easy to do and cops don't care so much?) EDIT: Thanks for the advice, I'll definitely take it in to consideration. Just to be clear I'm a 19 year old male, and I'm quite tall and muscular. I will most likely be travelling with another male friend and I've hitchhiked several times in Europe and in Ontario. I'm very street-wise and aware of my surroundings. However, with that said, I do take what you have said very seriously and hitchhiking will always be my last resort, it can definitely be very dangerous, especially in a place like BC. Edit: I also won't be going anywhere near the Highway of Tears.
