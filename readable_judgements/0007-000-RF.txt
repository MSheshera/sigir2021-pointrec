Description: Hello friends! I am going to Sayulita, Mexico in two days - booked the trip today! It's a smaller, lesser known town, this is my first solo trip, and as a person who likes to do her research, it makes me slightly nervous that I can't find too many tours/guides/reviews on it (although, maybe I should take this as a good sign as I don't want somewhere touristy/crowded?) I've been doing some research but as this is a spontaneous trip I came on here for advice, ideas, and tips for anything Sayulita before I jet off Monday. Things I've planned/am interested in: -A trip to the Marietas Islands -Yoga, possibly a 1-day yoga retreat/relaxation day (I've been looking and I'm not sure that's an option), but any yoga studios you went to & enjoyed would be super appreciated! Vinyasa is my favorite practice. -Good hiking spots (Monkey Mountain Hike - has anyone done this?) -meeting people, eating delicious (vegetarian food), finding cool local goods & environments. Questions: -Did anyone ride the bus from PVR to Sayulita? Was it an alright experience? I've read mixed reviews, but it's a great deal as long as I am not unsafe. -Did you have large problems with the ATM's/getting pesos? How much cash did you bring before arriving to the country? If you have answers/experiences to share for any or all of these questions, know you'll be making me a happy fellow friend! Appreciate it. :)
