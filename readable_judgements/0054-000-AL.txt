Description: Best Hiking in Utah Hey! I am visiting Utah in a couple weeks and am looking for the best trails/hikes to do. I'll be in the Moab area with a 4x4 car to get around. I am looking into visiting Arches, Monument Valley, Canyonlands. I am looking for harder level/remote hiking and that is also good for photography. Any recommendations? What are some good local spots that most tourists aren't familiar with? Thanks
