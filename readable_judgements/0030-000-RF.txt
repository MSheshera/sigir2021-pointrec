Description: Restaurant Recommendation HELP!? My wife and I are looking to have a good night out. Neither of us are big on the food scene and are kind of new to the Victoria area. We are NOT looking for anywhere: I need to wear a suit She needs to wear a dress/go over the top The bill will cost us more than our car payment We needed to book reservations 6 months ago We ARE looking for: Good portion sizes Quiet, intimate experience Good selection in foods, drinks and deserts Non-seafood (as I allergy and want to not die) So r/VictoriaBC, throw out your best recommendations and help me show my wife a good time! Thanks in advance!
