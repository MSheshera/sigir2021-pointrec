Description: I'd love to get some great museum recommendations for our trip at the end of this month (Tokyo for one week, then Osaka/Kyoto for one week). We don't need to go to a lot of museums, maybe a couple of really good ones. We're game for a lot of possible topics - science, art, history, unique specialty items - as long as the museum experience is well put together and engaging. And we are not into anime or manga or cosplay, so we know we're not really interested in those museums. Thanks so much!
