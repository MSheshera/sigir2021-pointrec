Description: I want to take my Dad out for a nice meal for a big birthday (really soon). Wondering if anyone can suggest anywhere? He is basically the typical grumpy old man, likes plenty on his plate, no waiters flapping over you (like good service!), no loud music, good ale on tap is a definite bonus and can't cost an arm and leg. It also has to be in walking distance of Charing Cross as he won't use the tube. Pubs or restaurants would be fine as long as they aren't crowded/noisy and meet the above criteria. Any suggestions?
